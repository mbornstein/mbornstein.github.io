      <h2>Experience and Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Within my work as student assistant, I earned the most experience about developing in a team. The biggest project was <em>openHPI</em>, were I worked for 15 months. Always have a look at my <a href="/data/mbornstein-resume.pdf">PDF Resume</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few projects I contributed to, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/mbornstein">Github</a>. For a computer graphics seminar, a fellow student and I worked on a 3D Scene viewer developed in C++ with Qt and OpenGL and implemented <em>Cascaded Variance Shadow Mapping</em>. Within a software technique and architecture course, we created the <em>Morphic Testing Framework</em>, which is a small framework to test the morphic UI of squeak smalltalk (like selenium for web applications). Lastly, for an HCI course, we built a fitness application for interactive floors, after a design thinking like process (<a href="data/paper.pdf">see our paper</a>).

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, I am studying IT-Systems Engineering at the Hasso-Plattner-Institute (HPI) in Potsdam. We learn a lot about programming and software architecture besides general computer science topics. In particular, I gained deeper knowledge about Internet technologies, information security and computer graphics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last 2 semesters of the bachelors degree, I had the possibility to do a project with a business partner and 5 fellow students. We have worked with Colgate-Palmolive and implemented a dynamic algorithm for real-time routing and clustering, using the SAP HANA in-memory technology with on-the-fly aggregated sales data. This enables Sales Representatives in France to negotiate products and promotions with retail stores more efficiently.

      <h2>Hackathons and CTFs</h2>
      <p>Since I am fascinated by OS and internet security, I regularly participate in open CTFs (<em>capture the flag</em> in infosec) together with my university team. (check us out <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/10365">here</a>)</p>
      <p>Furthermore, two friends and I won the third prize at <a href="http://devfest-berlin.de/#/2014/about">GDG DevFest 2014</a> (a Hackathon sponsored by Google and Immobilienscout24: <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/116495772997450383126/albums/6073481044801655761">Google+ Event Photos</a>). It was an awesome weekend event with lots of good talks about recent web, android and cloud topics. We developed a multiplayer 'halli galli' game as a webapp, that is played with smartwatches using the built-in motion sensor.</p>

      <h2>Music and Bands</h2>
      <p>
        Back in 2005, I joined the <em>Fanfarenzug Strausberg</em> as a drummer and started to learn playing the guitar after on. I took guitar lessons for 7 years in different music schools and am now practicing myself. Before my studies at the university, I played in several bands as a guitarist and bassist. We performed on dancing school and high school events. Nowadays, I meet with fellow students and colleagues to play just for fun.

      <h2>Photography and Filmmaking</h2>
      <p>Even though I chose the music path early in my life and rejected arts, I finally got into photography and bought myself a DSLR. I try to tease everything out of my gear. Because of the great open source culture, I can do even more using the Magic Lantern firmware. Feel free to check some pictures out <a href="/photography">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Sports</h2>
      <p>Back in school I used  to ride my bike a lot, but today I rarely have to overcome long distances. This is why I joined the local fitness centre and took some university sports courses. Windsurfing for example was a lot of fun, I even passed the windsurf exam and got the international basic license. Later, I started to boulder indoor. After times with aching hands, I find myself improving from time to time. Because there are so much kinds of sports to discover, I also enrolled for the parcours course in 2015.</p>
